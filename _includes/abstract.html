<p><strong>Momoka </strong>is a platforming adventure game set in a constellation of planets, presented in a vibrant low-polygon style. You control the heroine Momoka as she sets off on a quest to discover why her star is dying. Momoka's unique gameplay seamlessly switches from a solid platforming shooter within and between each of the planets, to exploration of the large planetary system using her spaceship. The storyline is woven into the experience through NPC interactions and an inventory of special items to collect, which enable access to previously locked areas of the planetary system.
