### Description

**Momoka**is an adventure platformer set in a constellation of planets.  Join our heroine as she jumps in her spaceship and heads off around her galaxy to find out why her star is dying. The game moves seamlessly from a 360 degree space shooter to a platform game on and within each planet.

Please note that momoka is still in development.  This site and this summary page will be updated and expanded in the course of development.

### Tech

Momoka is written for iOS 7, supporting both iPhone and iPad.  

Momoka supports Game Centre and MFi Game Controllers.

Momoka runs on OSX Mavericks and later.

### Background

Our first game for iOS was the elite-like exploration game *Firmament* back in the early days of the App Store.  After that we experimented with a number of game prototypes before we settled upon Momoka’s mechanics.

The intention with Momoka is to write an exploration & adventure game in the vein of Zelda & Metroid for iOS, but with the great platforming action and controls expected on iOS.  This style of gameplay fits iOS well, for although the story is immersive and detailed it allows the game to be played in short bursts by casual gamers if required.

Unique to Momoka is that the action takes place on round planets, which our heroine can move between by jumping in a rocket and taking off.  The game smoothly transitions from platforming to lander-like flying between planets.

The 2.5D approach keeps the controls simple, sharp and iOS appropriate by restricting the mechanics to that of a platformer, whilst still giving players the beautiful and cutting edge experience they have come to expect from the best of iOS games.
