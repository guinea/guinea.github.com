# Difficulty in computer games

How hard should my game be?  The obvious answer to this question is *easy to start and tough to finish*, but why? Why not make a game of uniform difficulty, or even a fiendishly difficult puzzler that eases off level by level as a reward for your perseverance?  Because it wouldn't be as much fun.

In game development, decisions regarding OpenGL, Audio Formats, or which scripting language to use, are optimisation problems.  Benchmark the alternatives and choose the best performing.  Decisions regarding gameplay want for the comforting advice of benchmark figures because you are effectively optimising for "fun", a quantity that is notoriously difficult to measure.

Beta testing is the closest analogue of benchmarking for "fun", but unless you have time to beta test every gameplay decision, you will need to look to your own judgment for guidance. It is tempting to ask "what makes a game fun?", but the question is too vague to answer. A better question for a Game Developer is "what makes a player keep playing my game?".  For me the two key factors are:

* mastering a skill, or appearing to master a skill.
* escapism, the chance to live "another life in another world"

A game's prowess at plucking a player from a tedious plane, or train, journey and placing them in a fantasy world is a topic worthy of thought, but it has no relevance to the game's difficulty level.  When setting difficulty we are tuning our games to tread that line between being an interesting challenge without being frustratingly difficult.  The key factor here is the feeling of mastering a skill.

Just like a pair of lion cubs half heartedly gnawing at each other's throats in a nature documentary, humans learn by playing. Our capability to learn has set us apart from all other species, and to guarantee that we exercise this skill evolution rewards us with "fun", hence happy demeanour of the lion cubs practicing their hunting skills, or the toddler honing his or her motor skills with help from a bucket full of coloured blocks. Computer games should tap into this evolutionary mechanism by providing you with a skill to learn, but ideally they should be tuned to save you the effort of actually learning them.

Driving around in the GTA universe, power sliding around corners and negotiating traffic jams with a handbrake makes me feel like I can drive like a racing driver. Of course I can't in real life. If I ever did pluck up the courage to tug on the handbrake during a turn it would certainly end in my fiery demise, but the carefully tuned physics of GTA give me "computer game driving", which unlike real driving is a skill I can master quickly, and feel great about.  In short, GTA has given me access to evolution's reward for learning a skill, without the cost of actually learning it.  That is a big part of why it is fun.
