title: Fork's inspirations
---

No creative endeavour exists in a vacuum.   From the first troglodyte painter mimicking the forms and tones of nature on his cave wall, to today's indie game developers, the act of creation has always been inspired by something.  Here we thought we'd talk about our inspirations for our new game, *Last Orbit*.

### Cave Story

*Cave Story* is an adventure platformer, probably the best we've played. There are elements of *Last Orbit* inspired by Cave Story, but its real legacy for us is the inspiration to return to indie games and start work on *Last Orbit*.

Pixel, *Cave Story*'s creator, chose his art, music and gameplay styles very carefully.  His choice of retro blocky graphics allowed him to polish and perfect the art in the time he had available.  Likewise the chip tune soundtrack not only complimented the pixellated graphic style, but was achievable on a limited budget.  He didn't hold back on the game itself though, he created an expansive world, populated it with lively characters and threaded an engaging story through this platforming action.  After considerable indie success, the game got picked up by a studio, who created a beautiful 3D version of Pixel's original  game for Nintendo's 3DS.  Surely this has to be the indie dream.


### Legend of Zelda: Link's awakening

Zelda eschewed the intricate fighting systems and complex lore that most fantasy games borrowed from the tabletop RPG universe in favour of an arcade approach to gameplay, albeit still swinging a sword.  Nevertheless the backdrop to this button bashing action is a vibrant fantasy world packed with puzzles, charming characters and 

I've spent many happy hours playing abstract video games, e.g Tetris or Bejeweled, but for me video games shine most brightly as art when they give the player a window into an alternate world, just as a book or a film does.  The unique aspect of video games is that the world must be interactive.  The Zelda games have been consistently achieving this for 25 years.

Is *Link's Awakening* the best Zelda? I have no idea.  Did I choose it because it is the first I played.  Yes.

### Lunar Lander

Ten years after Neil Armstrong parked the Eagle in the Sea of Tranquility, Atari were offering punters the chance to do the same with their coin operated "Lunar Lander" arcade machine.  Sadly I've never played the original, but the mechanic has been mimiced by coders ever since, and I've yet to find a flash clone I don't like(even Atari themselves [got in on the act](http://chrome.atari.com/lunarlander/)).  There is a simple pleasure to picking the perfect angle and deceleration curve so that your virtual Eagle kisses the simulated Lunar landscape with no more than a puff of virtual moon dust.

The tragedy with *Lunar Lander* is that no matter how skillfully you land your spaceship you can't get out and explore.  *Last Orbit* fixes this.  Zelda's *overworld* is replaced by a galaxy full of planets, which you fly between them in your *Lunar Lander* inspired spaceship.

### Super Mario Galaxy

It should be no surprise that the best-selling video game franchise of all time has influenced our creation, in particular Super Mario Galaxy.  Super Mario Galaxy's beautiful looks, intuitive and innovative controls, and vast explorable universe make it one of the highlights of a proud lineage of video games.

You may not think that every nerd's favourite Italian plumber belongs in this list, except for one thing.  Super Mario Galaxy's levels are near-spherical with a gravitational field to match. In the resulting cerebral, perplexing and perspective-skewing gameplay, Up is down, Left is Up, Down is 3 minutes ago, and soon I feel like I've been watching [Primer](http://xkcd.com/657/) on repeat whilst spinning on an office chair. If you don't own a Wii, fret not, you can fry your brain equally well asteroid hopping in *Last Orbit*. 

### Flat UI / Windows Metro

This is the only entry on the list which is not a game, nevetheless, the *Flat UI* design sensibility is a big part of *Last Orbit*.  For two tecchie types embarking on a game the most intimidating aspect is not the engine, the sound or the marketing, it is the art.  Quite simply, we are not artists.

Aware of our limitations, but intent on writing something both playable and beautiful we began to cast about for an design aesthetic that was attractive, but achievable by two artistically disadvantaged coders.  I've seen it written that the Neon aesthetic was *created by programmers who can't draw*.  This may be a true statement, in fact we went that route with [Boxel](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxel/id441537386?mt=8), but Neon is too strident and soulless to lend *Last Orbit* eiter charm or pathos so we moved on.  The retro pixellated look has been clich√©d for some time, and for the most part it is rather ugly, so that was discarded quickly too.  Eventually we settled on Flat UI look.  The simple bold style requires a minimal level of technical skill to achieve, yet when combined with abstract tiled patterns it can be beautiful. On top of that Flat UI reflects the bright and cheery atmosphere for *Last Orbit* and it fits well with the new generation of mobile operating systems that *Last Orbit* is destined to run on.
