# Level design

Ignoring what are probably best classed as "business" aspects of Indie game development such as timetabling, marketing, it seems to me that there are four fundamental creative roles required when building a game

- Programming (game engine coding, not scripting levels)
- Level design
- Art
- Music

In a large games studio these four roles would be neatly split between teams, but the curse and blessing of indie game development is that you must cover all four.  When looking at t

Programming and Level design never worried me.  I have a strong coding background and having played so many fun levels I did not forsee any trouble building some of my own. Music would be top of my list, but the problem is solved by paying a composer a very modest sum of money, so it does not worry me. Art is less simple. It is true that you can very cheaply contract an artist to draw you some sprites, but the process of art design is so central to your game that unless you can afford to employ that artist .  The only solution is   

Now, part the way through `fork` the ordering of my list looks very different.  Engine programming and Music are still the least worrisome for the same reasons, however in a plot twist I never expected Art has been knocked off the top spot by Level design.

Art it turns out is a very solvable problem.  I am no Leonardo, and I never will be, but creating a cartoony character with straightforward vector graphics turns out to be an easy skill to learn.  

Level design is my current nightmare.

Not easy to optimise for fun. Engine programming obvious optimisation, and even so with art - I have an art style in my head that I need to iterate towards, I can just keep tweaking until I manage it.
