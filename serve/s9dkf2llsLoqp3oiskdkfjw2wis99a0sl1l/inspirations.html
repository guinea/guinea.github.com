  <p>No creative endeavour exists in a vacuum.   From the first troglodyte painter mimicking the forms and tones of nature on his cave wall, to today&rsquo;s indie game developers, the act of creation has always been inspired by something.  Here we thought we&rsquo;d talk about our inspirations for our new game, currently codenamed <em>Fork</em>.</p>

<h3>Cave Story</h3>

<p><em>Cave Story</em> is an adventure platformer, probably the best we&rsquo;ve played. There are elements of <em>Fork</em> inspired by Cave Story, but its real legacy for us is the inspiration to return to indie games and start work on <em>Fork</em>.</p>

<p>Pixel, <em>Cave Story</em>&rsquo;s creator, chose his art, music and gameplay styles very carefully.  His choice of retro blocky graphics allowed him to polish and perfect the art in the time he had available.  Likewise the chip tune soundtrack not only complimented the pixellated graphic style, but was achievable on a limited budget.  He didn&rsquo;t hold back on the game itself though, he created an expansive world, populated it with lively characters and threaded an engaging story through this platforming action.  After considerable indie success, the game got picked up by a studio, who created a beautiful 3D version of Pixel&rsquo;s original  game for Nintendo&rsquo;s 3DS.  Surely this has to be the indie dream.</p>

<h3>Legend of Zelda: Link&rsquo;s awakening</h3>

<p>Zelda eschewed the intricate fighting systems and complex lore that many fantasy games borrowed from the tabletop RPG universe in favour of an arcade approach to gameplay, albeit still swinging a sword.  Nevertheless the backdrop to this button bashing action is a vibrant fantasy world packed with puzzles, charming characters and</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent many happy hours playing abstract video games, e.g Tetris or Bejeweled, but for me video games shine most brightly as art when they give the player a window into an alternate world, just as a book or a film does.  The unique aspect of video games is that the world must be interactive.  The Zelda games have been consistently achieving this for 25 years.</p>

<p>Is <em>Link&rsquo;s Awakening</em> the best Zelda? I have no idea.  Did I choose it because it is the first I played.  Yes.</p>

<h3>Lunar Lander</h3>

<p>Ten years after Neil Armstrong parked his spaceship in the Sea of Tranquility, Atari were offering punters the chance to do the same with the coin operated &ldquo;Lunar Lander&rdquo; arcade.  Sadly, I&rsquo;ve never played the original arcade version, but the mechanic has been copied slavishly by flash game authors (even Atari themselves <a href="http://chrome.atari.com/lunarlander/">got in on the act</a>), and I&rsquo;ve yet to find a clone I don&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>The tragedy with <em>Lunar Lander</em> is that no matter how skilfully you land you spaceship you can&rsquo;t get out and explore.  <code>Fork</code> fixes this.  Zelda&rsquo;s <em>overworld</em> is replaced by a galaxy full of planets, and you fly between them in your <em>Lunar Lander</em> inspired spaceship.</p>

<h3>Super Mario Galaxy</h3>

<p>Yes, it may be no surprise that the best-selling video game franchise of all time has influenced our creation. There is also no doubt that SMG is a fantastic creation on all counts. It looks fantastic. The Wii controls are both intuitive and innovative. The universe within is huge with an amazing amount to explore.</p>

<p>But perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see the Italian handyman in a list like this. Except for one thing: SMG contains near-spherical levels and a gravitational field to match, and this gives rise to a perplexing perspective-skewing cerebral gameplay experience. Up is down. Left is Up. Down is 3 minutes ago. If I had to pick an alternative activity to put me in the same mental state, I might say watching <a href="http://xkcd.com/657/">Primer</a> on repeat whilst spinning on an office chair. If you don&rsquo;t own a Wii, fret not. I present you with a third option: we like to think you will have a similar mental experience asteroid hopping in <em>Fork</em>.</p>

<h3>Flat UI / Windows Metro</h3>

<p>Clearly this isn&rsquo;t a game, but the <em>Flat UI</em> design sensibility is a big part of <em>Fork</em>.  For two tecchie types starting out on a game the most intimidating aspect is the art. I would love to write a game beautiful enough to be an oil painting, but without an artist in tow, it will never be.  Therefore we began to cast about for an aesthetic that was attractive, but achievable by two artistically disadvantaged coders.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it written that the Neon aesthetic was <em>created by programmers who can&rsquo;t draw</em>.  This may be a true statement, in fact we went that route with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxel/id441537386?mt=8">Boxel</a>, but Neon is rather too strident for a platformer like <em>Fork</em> so we moved on.  The retro pixellated look was quickly discarded as clich√©-common, and for the most part rather ugly before we settled on Flat UI.  The simple bold style requires a minimal level of technical skill to achieve, yet when combined with abstract tiled patterns can be very attractive indeed. Flat UI reflects the bright and cheery atmosphere for <em>Fork</em> and fits well with the new generation of phones and tablets that <em>Fork</em> is destined to run on.</p>
