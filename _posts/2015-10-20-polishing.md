Momoka has entered beta.  The game as such is done, we have played it from beginning to end many times, ironed out the bugs, and now we are opening it up to a wider audience.

What remains is to polish it, optimise the graphics for old devices, play it some more, and of course polish it.  Something we are particularly looking forward to is getting it running on the Apple TV.
