A lot has happened since our last post.  We’ve settled on a title, *Momoka*, rewritten a lot of the engine, and transitioned from 2D to 3D graphics. However, the story and the mechanics are the same.  *Momoka* is still a platform game that tells the story of a young girl setting off around her galaxy to save her dying sun.

The big change is in the rendering, *Momoka* is now 2.5D. That is to say the mechanics are those of a 2D platform game, but the graphics are 3D.  This allows us to keep the straightforward platformer controls, whilst greatly improving the appearance.

With the engine finished we have been able to make a start on the levels.  The screenshot above is from level 2, set in a space station, whereas the screenshot below shows our grassy cave rendering.

We’ll try not to leave it 14 months until the next post.  We have a lot of work to finish the first two levels and the story and material between them, not to mention the work we have planned on the graphics, but once that is done we will be releasing a beta.
