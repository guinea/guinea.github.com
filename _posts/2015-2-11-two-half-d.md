A lot has happened since our last post.  We’ve settled on a title, *Momoka*, after the game’s heroine, after we discovered *Star Life* was taken, but the story and the mechanics are the same.  *Momoka* is still a platformer telling the story of a young girl setting off around her galaxy to save her dying sun.  The big change is the graphics, *Momoka* is now 2.5D. That is to say the mechanics are those of a 2D platform game, but the graphics are 3D.

As well as the reworking of the graphics, we have finished the engine and almost finished writing the first two levels.

We’ll try not to leave it 14 months until the next post.  In fact we are approaching the point where will release a demo.  Sign up for our mailing list if you are interested.
