Momoka's Universe is growing every day. To keep the gameplay fresh as you move from sector to sector we've introduced power-up items that unlock new abilities in some of the major levels. On planet *Lost Ember* which is situated near the coldest edge of the universe, that power-up is going to come in the form of a freeze ray. You can use it to freeze your enemies, demonstrated here by our lovely robot assistant:

The freeze action has given us a surprising amount of extra gameplay, such as using it to access new areas:

Meanwhile on the less glamorous engine front we're having a bit of a performance sweep which involves cutting a bunch of models up. More on that in a future post.
