Progress on *Star Life* is rapid, but we aren't ready for a Demo yet.  In the meantime we have made this brief video of how Star Life has developed over time.

The numbers by the titles show the number of commits since starting work on *Star Life*.  A *commit*, for those not used to `git` or other Source Code Managers, is a snapshot of the game's source code, made so that we can back it up and distribute it across the team.  Each commit usually corresponds to miniature milestone, maybe a bug fix, or a mini feature, or just progress we didn't want to lose.  This video is a compilation of the more interesting milestones *Star Life* has passed during its development so far.
